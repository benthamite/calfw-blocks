* Installation
** Manual Installation
Clone this git repo (e.g. to `~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/')
#+begin_src
cd ~/.emacs.d
mkdir site-lisp
cd site-lisp
git clone https://github.com/ml729/calfw-blocks
#+end_src

And add its path to `'load-path':
#+begin_src emacs lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/calfw-blocks")
#+end_src

Make sure this package is loaded after calfw.

* Usage
This package comes with the following ~calfw~ views that display time blocks:
#+begin_src
'block-day
'block-week
'block-2-day
'block-3-day
'block-4-day
'block-5-day
#+end_src
The ~block-week~ view always starts on Sunday.
The ~block-day~ and ~block-<n>-day~ views always start on the current day. The top right button labelled ~Week~ uses ~block-week~.

The package also includes two-column transposed versions of the original calfw views (credit to @novoid for the [[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-calfw/issues/22][design]]), where days of the week are displayed vertically rather than horizontally:
#+begin_src
'transpose-8-day
'transpose-10-day
'transpose-12-day
'transpose-14-day
'transpose-two-weeks
#+end_src
The ~transpose-<n>-day~ views always start on the current day, and ~transpose-two-weeks~ always starts on the most recent Sunday. The top right buttons labelled ~W^T~ and ~2W^T~ use ~transpose-8-day~ and ~transpose-14-day~, respectively.

You can use these to define functions that directly open calfw with these views.
Examples:
#+begin_src emacs lisp
;; Calendar showing org-agenda entries
(defun my-open-calendar-agenda ()
  (interactive)
  (cfw:open-calendar-buffer
   :contents-sources
   (list
    (cfw:org-create-source "medium purple"))
   :view 'block-week))

;; Calendar showing org entries from files
(defun my-open-calendar-files ()
  (interactive)
  (cfw:open-calendar-buffer
   :contents-sources
   (list
    (cfw:org-create-file-source "Todos" "~/stuff/todos.org" "green")
    (cfw:org-create-file-source "Events" "~/stuff/events.org" "blue"))
   :view 'block-3-day))
#+end_src

* Customization
Notable customization options:
- ~calfw-blocks-earliest-visible-time~: what time of day the calendar starts at.
- ~calfw-blocks-show-time-grid~: shows a time grid if non-nil.
- ~calfw-blocks-default-event-length~: the length in hours of events with a start time but no end time; used to determine the size of the rendered block.
- ~calfw-blocks-lines-per-hour~: how many lines each hour gets.
- ~calfw-blocks-min-block-width~: the smallest width a block can be in characters (includes divider character). If there are too many concurrent events, some events are hidden so that all blocks are at least `calfw-blocks-min-block-width' characters wide.
